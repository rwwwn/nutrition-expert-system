ü•ó Nutrition Expert System

üìå Overview

The Nutrition Expert System is a rule-based application developed using the CLIPS programming language. It provides personalized dietary recommendations based on user inputs, including health conditions, fitness goals, and allergies. Additionally, it features a decision tree to assist users in identifying potential causes of fatigue.

üß† Motivation

Maintaining optimal nutrition is crucial for overall health and well-being. This expert system aims to bridge the gap between individuals and personalized nutritional advice by simulating consultations with a nutritionist. It serves as an educational tool and a foundation for further development in health-related expert systems.

üöÄ Features
 ‚Ä¢ Personalized Recommendations: Offers dietary advice tailored to specific health conditions (e.g., diabetes, anemia), fitness objectives (e.g., muscle gain, weight loss), and allergies (e.g., dairy, nuts).
 ‚Ä¢ Fatigue Diagnosis: Implements a decision tree to help users explore potential nutritional causes of fatigue.
 ‚Ä¢ User-Friendly Interface: Interactive prompts guide users through input collection with validation to ensure accurate data entry.
 ‚Ä¢ Single-Selection Inputs: Due to system constraints, users can select one option each for health condition, fitness goal, and allergy.
